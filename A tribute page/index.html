                <p> <strong>Muhammad Ali</strong> was born on January 17, 1942 and passed on June 3, 2016. He was an American professional boxer, activist, entertainer, poet, and philanthropist. Nicknamed <em> The Greatest</em>, he is widely regarded as one of the most significant and celebrated sporting figures of the 20th century, and was frequently ranked as the best heavyweight boxer and greatest athlete of the century.</p>
                <p>Ali was born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky. He began training as an amateur boxer at age 12. At 18, he won a gold medal in the light heavyweight division at the 1960 Summer Olympics and turned professional later that year. He became a Muslim after 1961. He won the world heavyweight championship from Sonny Liston in a major upset on February 25, 1964, at age 22. On March 6, 1964, he announced that he no longer would be known as Cassius Clay but as <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Muhammad Ali</span>.</p>
                <p>He was involved in several historic boxing matches and feuds, most notably his fights with Joe Frazier, such as the Fight of the Century, which has been called <q>the biggest boxing event, if not the biggest sporting event, of all time</q>  and the Thrilla in Manila, and also his fight with George Foreman, known as The Rumble in the Jungle, which was watched by a record estimated television audience of 1 billion viewers worldwide, becoming the world's most-watched live television broadcast at the time.</p>
                <p>He has been ranked the greatest heavyweight boxer of all time, and as the greatest sportsman of the 20th century by Sports Illustrated and the Sports Personality of the Century by the <abbr title="British Broadcasting Corporation">BBC</abbr></p>
                <p> Ali retired from boxing in 1981 and focused on religion, philanthropy and activism. In 1984, he made public his diagnosis of Parkinson's syndrome, which some reports attribute to boxing-related injuries, though he and his specialist physicians disputed this. He remained an active public figure globally, but in his later years made fewer public appearances as his condition worsened, and he was cared for by his family. Ali died on June 3, 2016.</p>
